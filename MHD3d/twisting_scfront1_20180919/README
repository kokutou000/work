2004.10.04: ver.00_for_f90 test run reproduced sa30a2

MPI: 1d prallelization for x coordinate

2004.10.07:  copy from  NL3DpwD_mpi_00a
2004.10.07:  3d array index order is changed to (z, y, x)
2004.10.18:  file number index is increased to four digits
2004.10.22:  pst.f90: ithe format of the COORDINATE files are changed
             from '6e15.5' to '*'.
2004.11.01:  copy from NL3DpwD_mpi_01c

2005.02.10: debug: pset.f90
   subroutine pset__resistivity: range of the do loops is extended into
   the whole range for cx, cy, and cz
   
2005.02.28: copy from NL3DpwD_mpi_02d (zero beta version)
   the following files are modified
	common.f90, iset.f90, main.f90, mhd.f90, mpiut.f90, out.f90,
        pset.f90, rkg.f90

2005.06.02: pset.f90
   pset__dt is updated.
   fast mode is correctly taken into account to calculate the time step.
2005.06.03: mhd.f90
   debug index in the coefficients of density diffusion
2005.06.07: common.f90
   remove diff_pr from common and namelist

2007.11.22:
	Artificial converging motion is imposed on k_z=1, which
   is one-grid above the photosphere.

2008.02.14:
   the emerging flux is included.
   Namelist nlist_ef added
   a new subroutine eflux.f90 
   mhd.f90, iset.f90, constants.f90, common.f90 modified

   Directory test_eflux is the directory to test eflux.f90

2008.02.17:
   mhd.f90
   dpr=0, dro=0 are imposed in the entire region
   in order to check whether pressure and density are well solved
   in the emerging process or not.
